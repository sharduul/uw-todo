You have been given a Task Management app (a "todo" list app). 
The following use cases are supported in this application - 

1. View the task board
2. View lists of tasks
3. Add new list
4. Add task to a list 
5. Copy the list

The application has been build with Angular 4.0 and Express.js Javascript frameworks. 
A local Mongo database is used as the application database. 
The complete project environment is available in a Linux emulator (on the right) where you can work on your code, execute it and interact with the app as well.

The application is partially implemented and a "Copy list" API has been provided for your use.

Your task is to implement the use case #5 using the above API:
- Clicking the vertical menu on list should open a menu
- And clicking on "Copy" should create another list with the same name
